There are many diets out there, sometimes it is even difficult to pick one. From this huge number of diets I like keto diet the most. And there are few reasons why.
First, it is quite simple to follow this diet. All you have to do is to eat food, which is low in carbs - meat, vegetables, dairy products, nuts, berries. So your breakfast might consist of eggs, avocado and keto bread. Then for the lunch, you can have chicken with vegetables on a side and even a keto dessert. There are plenty of them. In addition, dinner - anything that is left or various nutritious salads with some protein on a side.
Second, it is good for your body and your metabolic flexibility. Once you stay long enough on keto diet, you start using ketones as the source of the energy instead of glucose. Which means you are not dependent on sugars anymore and you can get the energy from any foods.
